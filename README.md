This project is divided into these parts:
1. [Install required packages](#Install-required-packages)
2. [Data Analysis and Manipulation](#Data-Analysis-and-Manipulation)
3. [Data Visualization ](#Data-Visualization)

## Install required packages
To run this project, you will need Python and the following Python libraries installed:

1. Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Plotly
5. Matplotlib
## Data Analysis and Manipulation
The project follows these steps:

1. Data Loading: Importing the data from CSV files.
2. Data Cleaning: Handling missing data, removing duplicates, and correcting errors to enhance data quality.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to summarize its main characteristics.
4. Visualization: Employing plots such as bar chart and scatter plots to understand the country affected most with Covid19.

## Visualization Insights
1. Detailed analysis of the dataset helped to understand the country with maximum no. cases along with total no. of death and recovered cases.
2. Insights help us to develop a predictive model for future.
