## Install required packages
To run this project, you will need Python and the following Python libraries installed:

1. Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Plotly
5. Matplotlib
## Data Analysis and Manipulation
The project follows these steps:

1. Data Loading: Importing data from CSV files.
2. Data Cleaning: Managing missing values, eliminating duplicates, and correcting errors to improve data quality.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examining the dataset to identify key patterns and insights.
